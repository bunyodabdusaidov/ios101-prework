## App Brainstorming 

* Telegram messenger
* X (aka Twitter)
* Discord
* Chess

* I would like to build Telegram messenger. It's a complex messenger app with all kinds of features. Although, I wouldn't be able to replicate the exact app, I would want to build messenger the resonates Telegram, especially the UI and features. Features would be the profile, personal chats, groups, channels, and bots.

## Notes

It wasn't too challenging to build the app since it didn't involve any complex features. Although navigating around the app and figuring out how to access the label attributes and modify them was a bit confusing.
